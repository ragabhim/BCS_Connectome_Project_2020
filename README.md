# The Connectome Project - Brain Cognitive Society, April 2020

This Summer Project is carried out under the Brain Cognitive Society, IIT Kanpur during April 2020 - July 2020.

## Objective

* To explore the emerging field of connectomics.
* To learn about the various techniques used in modern Neuroscience.
* To understand how models are being created to interpret the behaviour on the scale of networks within the brain.
* To study and model the circuits that govern the visual and the auditory systems (initial objective)
* To study and model the circuits that govern the olfactory system (current objective)
* To learn how to manage and handle a research project.

## Ideation

* Learn the basics of Neuroscience.
* Learn the basics of Non-invasive Imaging methods like fMRI, EEG, etc.
* Learn how to navigate through academic literature and find specific works
* Read papers and find paper to replicate.

## Impact

On a expansive and huge scale, developing a functional human connectome will be the next big thing in the medical industry, diagnosing various diseases, behavioural and mental and in the (data) analysis of the plethora of data our brains collect every waking and sleeping second - a complete new way to look at neuroscience. It would also help us predict certain aspects of human behaviour as well as understand the pathology behind certain psychological disorders

This project that we are attempting will also have a rich educative and social impact, plainly as it encourages more people (ourselves primarily) who are looking to understand brains, how we use them and the fascination associated with them.
